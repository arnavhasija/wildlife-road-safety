The purpose of this project is to analyze geospatial data spanning the last eight years to anticipate and prevent wildlife-vehicle collisions.

<h3>Description</h3>
Having personally witnessed the distressing sight of lifeless animals by the side of roads and highways during my recent drives, my concern has deepened significantly. These incidents, which appear to be increasingly prevalent, present a critical issue. In Canada, it's estimated that a wildlife-vehicle collision happens roughly every 38 minutes. In the province of Ontario alone, there are approximately 14,000 reported wildlife collisions involving large animals each year, constituting around 10% of all vehicle accidents in the region. These collisions not only pose immediate risks to both human and animal lives but also have far-reaching consequences, including contributing to population declines, particularly among rare and endangered species.

<h3>Purpose and Scope of Analysis</h3>

My mission is to harness the power of geospatial data obtained from the Alberta Wildlife Watch (AWW) Program, which collects data related to animal-vehicle collisions in Alberta. By identifying high-risk areas, understanding the species affected, and recommending protective measures, my aim is to reduce the occurrence and impact of these distressing incidents. I believe that the insights extracted from this project can serve as a blueprint for addressing similar challenges in regions across the globe where such incidents appear to be on the rise, contributing to global wildlife conservation efforts. 

My analysis will focus on the geographical distribution of animal-vehicle collisions, the species involved, and trends over the past eight years. I aim to identify collision hotspots, assess the consequences of roadways on wildlife, and suggest strategies to protect Alberta's ecosystems and its unique wildlife. Together, we can make a significant contribution to wildlife conservation and promote the harmonious coexistence of humans and animals.
